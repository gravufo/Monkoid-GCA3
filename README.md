Code for the Great Canadian Appathon 3

Description:
============

This game was created with the competition theme, Retro, in mind. As soon as we heard the theme, it hit us that we should reinvent the classical Tetris game. To do so, we wanted to keep the original base concept of blocks stacking on each other when they touch. We then decided to take it to another level and make it a movable Tetris interface by making the main platform move on two axes (x and y) which effectively separates the screen into 4 parts. To make it even more difficult, we decided that each quadrant of the screen has a different direction for blocks. Adding to that, we made the main platform the same size as one normal block, so it is harder to catch all the other blocks.

But, as the game goes on, you stack up on blocks and are able to catch blocks more easily. Originally, we wanted to add the concept of making three or more blocks of the same color touching disappear, but we didn't have enough time to implement that feature. We also wanted to add some kind of power-ups (i.e. bombs that would break your stacks and give you a lot of bonus points), but the lack of time also prevented that from happening.
